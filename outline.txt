1. Abstract
Summarize the entire project:

Objective: Generate realistic NFL plays using tracking data

Method: Sequence-based generative model (e.g., VAE or TimeGAN), plus an outcome prediction model

Evaluation: Realism of generated plays and accuracy of predicted outcomes

Key Results: Brief quantitative result or insight

2. Introduction
Motivation: Richness and potential of NFL tracking data, value of synthetic play generation for coaching, training, and analysis

Problem statement: Can we generate realistic football plays and predict their outcomes?

Contributions:

Generative model for full-player trajectory generation

Outcome prediction model for generated plays

Experimental evaluation of realism and accuracy

3. Background
Overview of player tracking data and its applications

Generative modeling in sports analytics (brief)

Outcome prediction in play-by-play analytics

Prior work in trajectory prediction (e.g., NBA or pedestrian datasets)

Positioning: How this builds on or extends prior work

4. Methods
A. Dataset
Describe your NFL dataset: tracking (test_tracking_week_1.csv), play context (plays.csv, games.csv), player info (players.csv)

Preprocessing steps:

Frame selection

Coordinate normalization (optional)

Temporal alignment (snap to pass)

Play outcome labeling (e.g., yards gained)

B. Trajectory Representation
Encode 22-player tracking per frame into tensors (e.g., [frames x players x features])

Optional dimensionality reduction or transformation (e.g., PCA, positional role grouping)

C. Generative Model
Architecture: VAE / TimeGAN / Transformer

Input: Noise + optional outcome condition

Output: Sequence of player positions

Training: Losses, optimization, any constraints

D. Outcome Predictor
Architecture: simple feedforward / LSTM / XGBoost

Input: Real or generated play trajectories

Output: Scalar or categorical outcome (yards, completion, success/failure)

5. Experiments
A. Experimental Setup
Train/val/test split

Evaluation metrics:

Generative: ADE/FDE, trajectory realism, formation constraints

Predictive: MAE, classification accuracy, F1

B. Baselines
Random play generation

Replayed historical plays

Heuristic formations

C. Results
Quantitative results (tables, figures)

Visualizations of generated vs. real plays (animations or trajectory plots)

Distribution of outcomes (histograms, density plots)

D. Ablation Studies
Impact of conditioning on outcomes

Impact of model architecture

Generalization to unseen team/play types

6. Discussion
Interpretation of results

Limitations (e.g., dataset size, overfitting, rare plays)

Real-world implications: coaching tools, strategy planning, training simulation

7. Conclusion
Recap contributions

Future work:

Add defense/offense separation

Model control (generate “safe” or “explosive” plays)

Extend to entire drives or sequences of plays
